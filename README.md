# Distributional Semantics in R

Following my Methods of Distributional Semantics in BelgradeR Meetup with Data Science Serbia, organized in Startit Center, Belgrade, 11/30/2016, several people asked me for the R code used for the analysis of William Shakespeare's plays that was presented. I have decided to continue the development of that code in order to advance the examples that I have shown then into a more or less complete and comprehensible text-mining tutorial with {tm}, {openNLP}, and {topicmodels} in R. All files in this GitHub repository are a product of that work.

The idea here is to provide an overview of selected R packages and functions for text-mining and modeling in distributional semantics. Instead of presenting functions and packages in a piece-wise fashion, I have decided to develop a full text-mining pipeline by combining the essential steps orderly and exactly as one would need to follow them to arrive at some useful Data Science production following data wrangling, checking for integrity, text pre-processing, and modeling.
